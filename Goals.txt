Seaport will be a Compositor/DE/GUI frontend (not sure) for allowing users to create their own Desktop GUI from scratch, either from a config file, or a GUI interface.
It will interface with a display server and provide a workspace for UI design, utilising a frontend in the GUI.conf file (or something like that), or allowing users to
just edit the configuration directly.

My goals for SEAPORT:

1. No bloatware, only required dependencies
2. Installable from mainline distribution package managers (apt, pacman, etc..)
3. No requirement to install via pip, flatpaks, rubies or any alternative package manager that doesn't come with a distribution by default.
4. Everything including keybinds, GUI, system settings is editable through a .conf file OR GUI frontend contained in said .conf file.
5. Work on most mainline distros, eg. Mainline Debian, Arch, Gentoo, other
6. Support universal corner rounding, transparency and blur, regardless of application/package
7. Have scene.pkg wallpaper support by default
8. Have extensive and easy to understand documentation, eg. beginner friendly
9. Have support for transparency blending between shapes, see example: https://imgur.com/a/pCjYIA0
10. Users can create shapes, animations, activity indicators, icons (and link icons to executable binaries), batteries, clocks and other essential UI elements.
11. Have support for Standard desktop environment, scrolling or tiling window manager-like behavior.
12. Support multiple workspaces and set screen bounds for usable window space.
13. Have user configurable keybindings.
14. Don't be a jerk, take user feedback seriously.

Essentially I want to create a minimal desktop environment with only the essentials to create your own GUI space with either little OR extensive linux experience.
