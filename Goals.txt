Seaport Linux Frontend will be a Wayland compositor that allows users to create their own Desktop GUI from the seaport.conf file or a GUI interface contained in said file.

My goals for SeaportLFE:

1. No bloatware, only required dependencies
2. Installable from mainline distribution package managers (apt, pacman, etc..) as well as the AUR.
3. No requirement to install via pip, flatpaks, rubies or any alternative package manager that doesn't come with a distribution by default.
4. Everything including keybinds, GUI, system settings is editable through a .conf file OR GUI frontend contained in said .conf file.
5. Work on most mainline distros, eg. Mainline Debian, Arch, Gentoo, other
6. Support universal corner rounding, transparency and blur, regardless of application/package
7. Have scene.pkg wallpaper support by default
8. Have extensive and easy to understand documentation, eg. beginner friendly
9. Have support for transparency blending between shapes, see example: https://imgur.com/a/pCjYIA0
10. Users can create shapes, animations, activity indicators, icons (and link icons to executable binaries), batteries, clocks and other essential UI elements.
11. Have support for multiple workflows, including standard desktop environment, scrolling wm or tiling wm like behavior.
12. Support multiple workspaces and set screen bounds for usable window space.
13. Have user configurable keybindings.
14. Don't be a jerk, take user feedback seriously.

Essentially I want to create a minimal desktop environment with only the essentials to create your own GUI space with either little OR extensive linux experience.
